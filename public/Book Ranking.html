<h1>The Best Book Series According to Stephanie</h1>
<h2>The top 3 series worthy of many re-reads.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>I appreciate how the series becomes darker with each intalment; not only in theme, but in the loss of innocense of character and viewer.</p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>A timeless classic. This hero's journey highlights self-development and the importance of companionship.</p>
<h3>Divergent (Series)</h3>
<p>A female protagonist who destroys the balance of the existing world by unapologetically being herself.</p>
