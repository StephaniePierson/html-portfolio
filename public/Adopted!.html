<h2>Help choose my name</h2>
We are looking for something with connections to ancient cultures that will fit with Bjorn and Freyja's theme. </br>
So far we have considered the following:
<ol>
    <li>Ragnar
        <ul>
            <li>This is a strong name, but doesn't quite fit.</li> 
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Loki
        <ul>
            <li>The meaning of trickster/mischevious is fitting, but it has become too mainstream due to the popularity of Marvel's Thor films.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Finnegan
        <ul>
            <li>Fun. Random. Celtic references, but it doesn't feel ancient enough.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Puck
        <ul>
            <li>Old English and Celtic origins for Goblin or Sprite.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
